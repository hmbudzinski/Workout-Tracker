## Employee Tracker

# What

The objective of this assignment was to create an workout app where a user can track their workouts by creating and completeing workouts as needed. The user can add a workout and decide whether they want to continue a workout or add a new workout. The user can then look at their dashboard that lists out their workouts in duration, pounds lifted, and pie graphs of what is in progress or completed. 

# Why

This assignment was meant to have us practice with a NoSQL database.

# Features

Users can create a track daily workouts, track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of the exercise as well as the distance traveled for cardio exercises.
