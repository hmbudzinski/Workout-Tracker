## Employee Tracker

# What

The objective of this assignment was to create an employee tracker so a manager can track who is on their team, what their roles are, what their salaries are, and other useful information. The manager can select what they would like to do; view their employees, add an employee, or remove an employee. From that selection the user is then prompted input some information regarding their employee and the table is updated.

# Why

This was our first exposure to MySql and manipulating data in the tables and database.

# How

I first created my database and seeds so I could have some data in the table to view and manipulate. Then I set up my initial prompt that asks the user what they would like to do. The first call I made to the database was the view all function as that is the most straight forward. The second call I got was the remove function, and then the add employee function last.

# Features

Managers can add, remove, and view all of their employees and their roles from my app.

# Difficultes

For some reason the add employee function was the hardest for me, it took me quite a while to work out the moving parts on this one. In the future I would like to be able to add more functions such as updating the employees role, viewing all employees by the department, and updating employees salaries.
